        question: `WHAT IS A HACKATHON?`,
        answer: `A hackathon is an event where student developers bring their passion for technology to 
        create a project in 24 hours. It is a chance to collaborate and create something unique in a number of forms â€“ 
        an app, a robot, or a website! It is an event where you can constantly think outside of the box! You will 
        hopefully learn something new along the way in our engaging environment! We will also have programming mentors 
        during the hackathon to answer any questions that you may have!`
